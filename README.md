I have a passion for the oceans. They play a huge role in climate and support the lives of millions of people. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major concern for long term sustainability for the fishing industry and ocean health. It undermines the efforts of fishers that employ legal and ethical means of fishing, threatens vulnerable populations of sea life, and contributes to declining ocean health

By using supervised and semi-supervised learning, I decided to develop an Anomaly Detection model that detects IUU activities using loitering events on any given trip for any given vessel, using real-time data obtained from Global Fishing Watch (GFW)

## Key Findings

### There is a linear seperable boundary between loitering signatures of vessels exhibiting IUU vs. non-IUU behaviours. This linear boundary can be exploited to develop a comprehensive Anomaly Detection Model that can detect IUU signatures in real-time

## Problem Statement

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing result in ocean exploitation and frequently use slave labour (blatant violations of human rights). Furthermore, IUU fishing is detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry. It undermines the efforts of fishers that employ legal and ethical means of fishing, threatens vulnerable populations of sea life, and contributes to declining ocean health.

This model classifies IUU events in real-time from a loitering event (as described by [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/faqs/what-is-loitering-event/)). Real-time data can be obtained from Global Fishing Watch's [API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/)

## Data Source

No explicit dataset was readily available. I used secondary datasets from current research conducted by Global Fishing Watch (GFW) to create the pertinent dataset required for this analysis: 

- Illegal human trafficking on Ships: Through eyewitness accounts, prosecution data, and machine learning, GFW has classified vessel characteristics and movement data for ships suspected to be engaged in human trafficking from. This dataset, found here, contains labelled responses per ship per year (illegal trafficking yes/no) with anonymized ship IDs from 2012 to 2018. Each datapoint is one shipâ€™s cumulative operating characteristics every year, with the dataset containing 66,369 samples.

- Loitering events: By analyzing GPS and AIS data, GFW has identified loitering events (under a certain set of rules) for ships from 2012 to 2019. This dataset includes characteristics of the loitering event, also called trip signature in this report, for given ship IDs. Each datapoint is one loitering event, with the dataset containing 190,344 samples.
